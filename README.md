# What's For Lunch Generator
 The What's For Lunch generator came about when I was stumped from what to create. I asked a friend for an idea of something fun but practical to create. She suggested a random lunch generator - as many of us struggle to decide what to eat on several occassions.

 The code for this project uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Goals

 As many of us can be pretty selective about what we want to eat, simple random generation wasn't enough for my own needs. Is somoeone vegan? Do we have a lot of time? Do we want to keep spending low? I decided to incorporate toggleable preferences into the mix so everyone's need would be met.

 I also wanted the tool to be simple to use at a glance. "I'm looking for something..." is bolded and catches the eye in the center, with preferences right below it, encased in selectable bubbles. If the user has no preferences all what they want, they can just hit the fairly large "Pick For Me" button at the bottom, and the app will work like a typical random generator.
 
 To keep the experience clean, I implimented the ability for a selection to not appear twice in a row (as this may appear buggy). For a touch of humor while making this, "Water" is added to the list if users are too picky.
 
 I wanted to keep the aesthetic minimal with a simple grey background, paired with eye catching orange and red tones for the selections. The UI/UX is dynamic, with scaling and fillable hoverovers for visual interest.

 "Find X Near Me" will divert the user to Google, so they may find their dining preference nearest to them.
 
## Lessons Learned

 I wanted to go out of the box and create something tailor made for the app, by turning buttons into data containers. I also wanted to try out some some simple animated UI elements to give the project a bit of interest. Although some of the code is a bit redundant, I felt it best to maintain the code's simplicity as there's a fair bit of data needing to be checked at once and the simplicity allows users to know exactly what's being shown at a glance.

## Setup

 The project can be download and run easily by opening the app_lunch.html file. It will open in your default browser.

## Instructions

 You may immedately select "Pick For Me" for a completely random selection from the list of options. Additionally, preferences can be toggled, so you may find an option that works best for you.
